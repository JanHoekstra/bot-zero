# bot-zero
<a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a> is a fantastic project that enabled us to build great bots. The aim of this project is twofold:

1. Provide an "empty" project to build your own Slack chat bot
2. Provide 2 example implementations of tools / commands that run on ES6 (instead of Coffeescript).

## Clean up
The bot was generated using the <a href="http://slackapi.github.io/hubot-slack/">Slack Developer Kit for Hubot</a>. It was "cleaned" using a script from <a href="https://keestalkstech.com/2018/04/cleaning-up-the-default-hubot-installation/">Cleaning up the Default Hubot Installation</a>. We've added the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-command-mapper">Hubot Command Mapper</a> package to make it easier to map commands to Hubot (no regex needed). Testing is done using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-pretend">Hubot Pretend</a>.
